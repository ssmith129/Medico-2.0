## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas

#### AI Service Dependency
**Risk**: AI service failure could impact core functionality
**Mitigation**: 
- Implement fallback to traditional mode
- Set up AI service health monitoring
- Create AI service redundancy
- Cache AI results for offline use

#### Data Migration
**Risk**: Data loss or corruption during migration
**Mitigation**:
- Complete data backup before migration
- Implement rollback procedures
- Validate data integrity at each step
- Test migration on staging environment

#### User Adoption
**Risk**: Users may resist new AI features
**Mitigation**:
- Provide comprehensive training
- Make AI features optional initially
- Gather user feedback continuously
- Implement gradual feature introduction

### Medium-Risk Areas

#### Performance Degradation
**Risk**: New features may slow down the system
**Mitigation**:
- Implement performance monitoring
- Optimize code and database queries
- Use caching strategies
- Load test before deployment

#### Integration Issues
**Risk**: Problems with existing systems
**Mitigation**:
- Thorough integration testing
- Maintain API compatibility
- Implement graceful degradation
- Prepare rollback procedures

## Rollback Procedures

### Emergency Rollback (< 5 minutes)
```bash
# Quick rollback to previous version
kubectl rollout undo deployment/unified-chat
kubectl rollout status deployment/unified-chat

# Verify rollback success
kubectl get pods -l app=unified-chat
curl -f http://localhost:8080/health
```

### Planned Rollback (< 30 minutes)
1. **Notify Users**: Send advance notification about rollback
2. **Stop New Deployments**: Halt any ongoing deployment processes
3. **Database Rollback**: Restore previous database schema if needed
4. **Code Rollback**: Deploy previous version of the application
5. **Verify Functionality**: Test core features work correctly
6. **Monitor System**: Watch for any issues post-rollback

### Data Recovery Procedures
```sql
-- Restore messages table from backup
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS messages_backup;
CREATE TABLE messages_backup AS SELECT * FROM messages;

-- Restore from previous backup
INSERT INTO messages SELECT * FROM messages_backup_20250101;

-- Verify data integrity
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM messages;
SELECT MAX(created_at) FROM messages;
```
